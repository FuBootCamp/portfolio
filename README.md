# portfolio

## Description
```
This website is the result of the second challenge of the coding boot camp 2024 given and coordinated by Tec de Monterrey and edX. The project corresponds to the CSS Advanced module, where concepts such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables are expected to be applied. The User Story and the acceptance criteria are the follows:
```

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Notes
```Having a presentation portfolio seems to be a must for any programmer looking to get a job. Currently, I am not in this business, but it is a possibility for the future. 
In the portfolio you should present work already done, but as I don't have one yet, in the links of the page I only make reference to the page I developed as part of PRE_WORK of the same boot camp. The portfolio has 5 links that should link to 5 different projects, but in this case, they all refer to the same one.
In the recent photography link I decided to put a 3d avatar, to make the page more fun. 
The contact information in the portfolio is not real.
I tried to make a page with harmony of colors and shapes. I included free use photographs so as not to infringe copyright. Thanks to Joana Kosinska, Yogendra Singh, and absolutvision.
